  "description": "'Wrangler' is a very small module that smoothes over some of the gotchas in JavaScript type checking and casting. It behaves the way you (or perhaps just I) would expect type checking to work -- e.g., is.object() only works on objects that are neither arrays nor regular expressions. It also makes indexOf() easier to use, and provides search functions. Works in Node; should work in browser as well, exporting a variable 'is' into the global namespace.",
