  "description": "Is.js is a very small module that smoothes over some of the gotchas in JavaScript type checking. It behaves the way you (or rather, I) would expect type checking to work -- e.g., is.object() only works on objects that are neither arrays nor regular expressions. It also makes indexOf() easier to use.",
